# Collaborito â€“ Mobile App Requirements

## Project Description
Collaborito is a mobile app that facilitates collaboration between users on projects. The app enables users to create projects, invite collaborators, communicate through real-time chat, manage tasks, and leverage AI capabilities for enhanced productivity.

The core functionality includes user authentication via LinkedIn OAuth, project management, real-time messaging, task management, and file sharing. The app is enhanced with AI features powered by Claude 3.7, providing intelligent assistance such as chat summarization, task generation, and writing assistance.

Built with Expo React Native and TypeScript, the app uses Supabase for backend services (authentication, database, storage, and serverless functions). The development follows a phased approach, starting from foundation setup and progressing through core features, AI enhancements, and final polishing before deployment to app stores.


before start Just make sure to make it super modern, add microanimations, and generate some mockup screenshots with SVGs and i want best animations you can use 21st.dev mcp server of reffer other docs like shadcn or tailwind css
