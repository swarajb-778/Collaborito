- **Async/Await**: Resolved Promise type issues and cascading async method calls
- **Property Access**: Corrected database query result type handling

### 2. Service Architecture Standardization
- **Import Patterns**: Standardized from named imports to factory function calls for services
- **Circular Dependencies**: Implemented require() patterns to avoid import cycles
- **Missing Methods**: Added all required methods to service interfaces for complete functionality
- **Type Consistency**: Aligned service method signatures with their implementations

### 3. Component and Context Improvements
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling with recovery mechanisms
- **Context Types**: Added missing properties and fixed method signatures
- **Event Handlers**: Proper TypeScript annotations for component interactions
- **Cross-platform APIs**: Fixed React Native vs Web API compatibility issues

### 4. Database and Query Optimizations
- **Type Casting**: Proper handling of Supabase query result types
- **Property Access**: Fixed avatar_url access patterns with type assertions
- **Query Safety**: Enhanced type safety for database operation results

## Verification Steps

To verify all fixes are working:

1. **Run TypeScript Check**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
   Should show minimal non-critical errors

2. **Start Application**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   Should start without compilation errors

3. **Test Core Flows**:
   - Sign up new user
   - Complete onboarding flow
   - Navigate between screens
   - Test error scenarios

4. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   Should pass with proper type safety
