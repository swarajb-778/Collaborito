# Onboarding Backend Integration - Complete Progressive User Creation System

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive onboarding backend integration solution that implements **Progressive User Creation** - a system that handles new users who start locally and are migrated to Supabase during the onboarding process.

## Architecture Overview

### Problem Solved
- **Local User IDs**: Users initially get local IDs like `"new1750312207493"`
- **Session Validation Issues**: System tried to validate Supabase sessions before users existed in Supabase
- **UUID Validation Errors**: Frontend sent numeric IDs but database expected UUIDs
- **No Backend Integration**: Onboarding data wasn't properly saved to Supabase

### Solution: Progressive User Creation

The system now handles a **3-phase user lifecycle**:

1. **Phase 1 - Local User**: User signs up, gets local ID, stored locally
2. **Phase 2 - Migration**: During profile step, user is created in Supabase Auth + Database
3. **Phase 3 - Supabase User**: All subsequent steps save directly to Supabase

## Core Services Architecture

### 1. SessionManager.ts - Progressive Session Management
**Purpose**: Handles both local and Supabase users with seamless migration

**Key Features**:
- `initializeSession()`: Detects user type and initializes appropriate session
- `migrateUserToSupabase()`: Creates Supabase Auth user and profile during onboarding
- `needsMigration()`: Checks if local user needs migration
- `isMigrated()`: Determines if user has been migrated

**Migration Process**:
```typescript
// During profile step:
1. Check if user needs migration (local user)
2. Create Supabase Auth user with email/password
3. Create profile in profiles table
4. Update session to migrated state
5. Initialize onboarding state for Supabase user
```

### 2. OnboardingFlowCoordinator.ts - Unified Flow Management
**Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire onboarding flow with backend integration

**Key Features**:
- `initializeFlow()`: Sets up flow for any user type
- `executeStep()`: Executes steps with proper validation and saving
- `skipStep()`: Handles step skipping with tracking
- `getStepRoute()`: Determines next step based on user progress
- `canProceed()`: Validates flow state and permissions

**Flow Logic**:
```typescript
Profile → Interests → Goals → [Project Details] → Skills → Complete
                              ↑
                         (Conditional based on goals)
```

### 3. OnboardingStepManager.ts - Data Management
**Purpose**: Handles saving and retrieving onboarding data

**Key Features**:
- Supports both local and migrated users
- UUID validation for all foreign keys
- Graceful fallback for invalid data
- Automatic migration triggering during profile step

**Methods**:
- `saveProfileStep()`: Handles migration + profile creation
- `saveInterestsStep()`: Saves user interests with UUID validation
- `saveGoalsStep()`: Saves goals and determines next step
- `saveProjectDetailsStep()`: Creates projects for cofounders
- `saveSkillsStep()`: Saves skills and completes onboarding

### 4. SupabaseDatabaseService.ts - Database Operations
**Purpose**: Centralized database operations with proper error handling

**Key Features**:
- `createUserProfile()`: Creates user profile after Auth creation
- `saveUserInterests()`: Manages user-interest relationships
- `saveUserGoals()`: Saves goals with proper typing
- `saveProjectDetails()`: Creates projects and memberships
- `saveUserSkills()`: Saves skills and marks onboarding complete
- `getAvailableInterests()`/`getAvailableSkills()`: Loads reference data

### 5. OnboardingErrorRecovery.ts - Comprehensive Error Handling
**Purpose**: Handles all error scenarios with graceful recovery

**Key Features**:
- Error type analysis (network, session, migration, validation)
- Automatic retry mechanisms with backoff
- Offline data storage for later sync
- Migration retry marking
- User-friendly error dialogs

**Recovery Strategies**:
- **Network Errors**: Save locally, sync when online
- **Session Errors**: Attempt session recovery
- **Migration Errors**: Mark for retry, allow local continuation
- **Validation Errors**: Show user-friendly messages

### 6. DataValidationService.ts - Security & Data Integrity
**Purpose**: Validates all data before saving to prevent issues

**Key Features**:
- XSS/injection prevention
- UUID format validation
- Field length and format validation
- Suspicious content detection
- Comprehensive error and warning reporting

## User Flow Examples

### New User Onboarding Flow

```typescript
1. User signs up → Local ID: "new1750312207493"
2. Goes to profile screen
3. SessionManager detects local user, needs migration
4. User fills profile form
5. OnboardingFlowCoordinator.executeStep('profile', data):
   - Validates data with DataValidationService
   - SessionManager.migrateUserToSupabase():
     - Creates Supabase Auth user
     - SupabaseDatabaseService.createUserProfile()
     - Updates session to migrated state
   - Returns success with next step
6. Subsequent steps save directly to Supabase
7. OnboardingComplete: User is fully migrated and onboarded
```

### Error Recovery Flow

```typescript
1. Network error during interests save
2. OnboardingErrorRecovery.recoverFromError():
   - Analyzes error type (network)
   - Saves data locally for later sync
   - Shows user "Saved locally" message
   - Returns success to continue flow
3. When connection restored:
   - OnboardingErrorRecovery.syncPendingData()
   - Syncs all offline operations
```

## Database Schema Integration

### Tables Used
- `profiles`: User profile data
- `user_interests`: User-interest relationships
- `user_goals`: User goals and priorities
- `projects`: Projects created during onboarding
- `project_members`: Project membership
- `user_skills`: User skills with proficiency

### Key Fields
- All foreign keys use UUID format
- `onboarding_step`: Tracks current step
- `onboarding_completed`: Boolean completion flag
- `created_at`/`updated_at`: Timestamps for all records

-- Create proper indexes for performance
```
