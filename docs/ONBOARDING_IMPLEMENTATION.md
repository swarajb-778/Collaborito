3. **update-onboarding-step** - Updates step progress

### Database Schema

- **profiles**: User profile information
- **user_interests**: User selected interests
- **user_goals**: User goals and preferences
- **user_skills**: User skills and proficiencies
- **projects**: User project information

## Testing

**src/__tests__/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.test.ts**
- Complete test coverage for all onboarding steps
- Email validation tests
- Flow coordination tests
- Error handling validation
- Integration flow testing
- Mocked Supabase for isolated testing

## Key Features

### 1. Real-time Session Management
- Automatic session recovery
- Integration with Supabase Auth
- Offline support with cached data

### 2. Dynamic Flow Coordination
- Goal-based routing logic
- Step skipping capabilities
- Progress tracking and validation

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Network connectivity checks
- User-friendly error dialogs
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Offline mode support

### 4. Production-Ready Logging
- Structured logging with log levels
- Debug, info, warn, error levels
- Context-aware logging for troubleshooting

### 5. Analytics and Metrics
- Completion tracking
- Step-by-step analytics
- Time-to-complete metrics
- Device and platform tracking

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### Onboarding Steps Configuration
```typescript
const ONBOARDING_STEPS = [
  'profile',
  'interests', 
  'goals',
  'project_details', // conditional based on goals
  'project_skills'
];
```

## Usage

### Initialize Onboarding
```typescript
import { OnboardingOrchestrator } from '../services';

const orchestrator = new OnboardingOrchestrator();
await orchestrator.initializeOnboarding(userId);
```

### Execute Step
```typescript
const success = await orchestrator.executeStep(userId, 'profile', profileData);
```

### Check Completion
```typescript
const completionService = OnboardingCompletionService.getInstance();
const isCompleted = await completionService.isOnboardingCompleted(userId);
```

## Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- User data isolation
- Secure API key management
- Input validation and sanitization

## Performance

- Lazy loading of onboarding data
- Cached progress and state
- Optimized Supabase queries
- Efficient re-rendering with React optimizations

## Deployment

The system is ready for production with:
- Error boundaries for crash prevention
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Analytics for user behavior tracking
- Offline support for poor connectivity

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test src/__tests__/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.test.ts
```

### Reset Onboarding (Development Only)
```typescript
const completionService = OnboardingCompletionService.getInstance();
await completionService.resetOnboarding(userId);
```

## Migration Guide

When deploying to production:

1. Run Supabase migrations in `/supabase/migrations/`
2. Deploy Edge Functions from `/supabase/functions/`
3. Set up Row Level Security policies
4. Configure environment variables
5. Test onboarding flow end-to-end

## Support

For troubleshooting:
1. Check application logs for structured error messages
2. Verify Supabase connection and permissions
3. Test with onboarding reset in development
4. Review analytics for user flow insights
