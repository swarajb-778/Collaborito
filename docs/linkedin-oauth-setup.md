## Troubleshooting

### Redirect URI Issues
- Make sure the redirect URI in Supabase matches exactly what's in your LinkedIn app settings
- For development on physical devices, ensure the deep linking is properly configured

### Authentication Failures
- Check your Client ID and Secret
- Verify that your Supabase project has the LinkedIn provider enabled
- Make sure your app's authorized scopes include `r_liteprofile` and `r_emailaddress`

### Deep Linking Problems
- Confirm the scheme in `app.config.js` matches what you're using in your redirect URI
- Test deep links using `npx uri-scheme open collaborito://auth/callback --android` or `--ios`
