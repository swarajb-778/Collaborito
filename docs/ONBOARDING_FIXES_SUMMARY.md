# Onboarding Fixes Summary

## Problem Statement

The user reported a persistent 2-week issue with their React Native Expo app's onboarding process:
- **Signup worked** but profile updates failed during onboarding
- **"Failed to update user profile" errors** consistently occurred
- **Onboarding flow incomplete** - users couldn't complete the process

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified:
1. **Profile Service Import Conflicts** - Case-sensitive file naming issues
2. **Database Schema Mismatches** - Missing columns (oauth_provider, username)
3. **Service Export Problems** - Mixed static/instance method exports
4. **Import Path Errors** - Incorrect service imports across onboarding screens
5. **Type Interface Mismatches** - Different UserSkill interfaces

### Database Issues:
- Missing `oauth_provider` column in profiles table
- Inconsistent field naming (camelCase vs snake_case)
- Profile creation trigger not working properly

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Created Clean Working Service (`workingOnboardingService`)
**Files:** `src/services/workingOnboardingService.ts`

- ✅ **Complete onboarding flow implementation**
- ✅ **Direct Supabase integration without dependencies**
- ✅ **Consistent interface and error handling**
- ✅ **Full TypeScript support**

#### Methods Implemented:
- `saveProfileStep()` - Save user profile data
- `getAvailableInterests()` - Load interests from database  
- `saveInterestsStep()` - Save user interest selections
- `saveGoalsStep()` - Save user goals with conditional routing
- `getAvailableSkills()` - Load skills from database
- `saveSkillsStep()` - Save skills and complete onboarding

### 2. Fixed Database Schema Issues
**Files:** `src/services/ProfileService.ts`

- ✅ **Removed non-existent column references**
- ✅ **Fixed oauth_provider column dependency**
- ✅ **Corrected field mapping issues**

### 3. Updated All Onboarding Screens
**Files:** 
- `app/onboarding/index.tsx` (Profile)
- `app/onboarding/interests.tsx` (Interests)
- `app/onboarding/goals.tsx` (Goals)
- `app/onboarding/project-skills.tsx` (Skills)

- ✅ **Consistent service import patterns**
- ✅ **Updated to use workingOnboardingService**
- ✅ **Fixed type interface mismatches**
- ✅ **Proper error handling and logging**

### 4. Fixed Service Export Structure
**Files:** `src/services/index.ts`

- ✅ **Corrected import case sensitivity**
- ✅ **Fixed namespace vs instance exports**
- ✅ **Resolved compilation errors**
